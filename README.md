# Framework for Backpropagation with Matrices

This is the Github repository for my masters thesis about backpropagation with matrices.
This repository contains all the code I wrote and some examples of how to use it.

The different implementations for the automatic differentiation prt are in folder [./src/app/AD](src/app/AD).
The implementations for backpropagation with examples for feed forward neural networks can be found in [./src/app/Backpropagation](src/app/Backpropagation).
There are some unit test files in the [./src/app/Tests](src/app/Tests) folder, the can be used to check the corretness of the algorithms.
